# Python Data Tools

A multi-platform comparison of data wrangling techniques from **"Python for Data Analysis, 3rd Edition"** by Wes McKinney.

**Compare the same operations across:**
- 🐼 **Pandas** - Original book examples (baseline)
- 🦆 **DuckDB** - In-process SQL analytics
- ☁️ **BigQuery SQL** - Cloud data warehouse
- 🐻‍❄️ **Polars** - High-performance DataFrames

*Designed for extensibility—future support for ibis, chdb, and more.*
